```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

ggplot2的分面有两种方式，分别使用 facet_wrap 或 facet_grid 函数。
主要参考: ggplot2作图详解4：分面(faceting) <https://www.plob.org/article/7653.html>.


```{r}


```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
